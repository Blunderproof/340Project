/*
SVG elements are organized in the following way:
There are base level groups for the major geographical sections (US/Canada/Mexico)

There are base level groups for the added map features (city dots, city text, routes, train paths)

Routes and train paths are all groups of svg shapes, each has a tag as follows:
Routes: Color-LeftMostCity-RightMostCity
Colors are abbreviated to their first or first and last characters (O, P, Gn, Gy, Bk, Be, Y, W)
If there are multiple connections between two cities there is a 1 or 2 inserted in. 1 being the generally most upper left one

Train Paths:
tp-LeftMostCity-RightMostCity
Like the routes one, there are many paths with an included 1 or 2 with 1 being the upper left most one.
EX: tp-1-Denver-KansasCity
